    <h2>Introduction: The E-Waste Gold Rush</h2>
    <p>There's a hidden treasure trove lurking in your forgotten drawers, basements, and even landfills, one that's more concentrated than some of the richest gold mines on Earth. Every year, the world casually discards electronics containing an astonishing $91 billion worth of precious metals, including gold, silver, and copper. To put it in perspective: your old smartphone might contain more gold per kilogram than the ore found in traditional gold mines.</p>
    <p>Yet, instead of reclaiming this urban gold mine, over 40% of global electronic waste ends up buried or burned, poisoning the planet rather than enriching it. But what if there was a smarter, cleaner, and dramatically more sustainable way to tap into these forgotten riches?</p>
    <p>Enter Mint Innovation, an audacious startup using biotech to revolutionize how we recover precious metals. Forget pickaxes and dynamite; think microbes and innovation. Welcome to the new gold rush—one where the riches aren't underground, but hidden right inside your old devices.</p>
    
    <h2>Who are Mint Innovation?</h2>
    <p>Mint Innovation is a pioneering cleantech startup using eco-friendly biotechnology and microbes to efficiently extract precious metals like gold, silver, and copper from electronic waste, driving forward sustainable urban mining solutions.</p>

    <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Founded in 2016 in Auckland by Dr. Will Barker and Ollie Crush, stemming from basement-lab R&D</li>
      <li>Raised NZ$20M (~US$14M) Series B to build biorefineries in Sydney and Northwest England; Sydney plant processes ~3,500 t/e-waste/year</li>
      <li>U.S. expansion underway: Secured site for first American biorefinery and hired U.S.-based COO Jason Price to steer scale-up</li>
      <li>Winner of InnovationAus Excellence 2023; active in U.S. market growth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Their Technology Works</h2>
    
    <p>When I was building HobbySolver, one of the biggest frictions wasn’t growth or user onboarding—it was payments. Specifically, how do you handle split payments between mentors and the platform? How do you onboard sellers compliantly, manage payouts, and stay out of regulatory trouble?</p> 


    <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
    <p>With 6,000 GWh in contracts expiring soon, BEPC is positioned to benefit from rising power prices. Their $12.5B M&A activity in 2024, including deals in PJM and talks to acquire Neoen, supports future growth.</p>

    <h2>Growth and Global Expansion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Revenue (2024): $4.57B; Net Income: $236M (vs. $-181M in 2023).</li>
      <li>P/E Ratio: 19.53; ROE: 1.81%; ROA: 2.23%.</li>
      <li>Current Ratio: 0.28; Total Debt/Equity: 116.39%.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Future of Urban Mining</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Current Price: $25.58 (April 2025)</li>
      <li>DCF estimates range from $22.16 to $60.76 per share.</li>
      <li>Comps: EVRG (17.5), IDA (20.8), HE (4.8) — BEPC is fairly valued.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion: A Circular Future</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risks:</strong> Interest rates, currency, climate exposure, regulatory changes</li>
      <li><strong>Catalysts:</strong> M&A, Microsoft partnership, May 2025 earnings, dividend growth</li>
    </ul>
